		<h1 class="medium">I know, I can't force you to read it.</h1>
		<h1 class="small">But if you're still here, it's probably only because you need to hire somebody and have been dragged into the process kicking and screaming. Perfect. You're exactly the kind of person I need to talk to! I want to build things. Let me be your way out of this hiring fiasco.</h1>
		<div class="tiny">You probably can't read this. That's OK. I really like the way type appears on screen, so I'm using this in lieu of a horizontal rule; the ramifications of which are still unknown. We're in new territory here.</div>

			<h2>I have skills in</h2>
			<h2>Web Development.</h2>
			<p>Progressing through a coding bootcamp brought me to a level of basic web development competency in just 8 weeks. That's a big deal because web development is hard. It also taught me to learn a faster than I thought was possible. What I've learned includes HTML5, CSS3 (including animations and transitions), SASS/LESS, jQuery, Git and static site generators like Jekyll and Middleman. I'm also pretty good with CSS frameworks, javascript and Ruby on Rails. I can get things done in Photoshop and Illustrator and I'm known for having strong design sense.</p>

			<h2>in Advertising.</h2>
			<p>Packaging information and ideas was my first love. I've spent a lot of time deconstructing and rebuilding brands and can do that for something existing or develop an identity for something new. Behind these activities are numerous decisions like identifying a viable target audience and positioning the brand in a crowded market, reach and frequeny. If these buzz words sound like buzz words I'd be excited to package them in a different way. I love communications problems!

			<h2>in Storytelling.</h2>
			<p>VFS's Writing for Film and Television program showed me the right way to take an idea or concept and build a world around it, populating it with believable characters who have motivations and goals. Screenwriting also contains a structure that needs to be adhered to as you move a character through obstacles and trials they have to overcome to ultimately change and grow. Storytelling is about engaging an audience.</p>
